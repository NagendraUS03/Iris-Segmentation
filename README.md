**Iris Segmentation Project** 

***Project Description***
This project focuses on implementing a robust iris segmentation technique using computer vision and image processing. It aims to isolate and preprocess the iris region from eye images to facilitate accurate biometric recognition. Applications include identity verification, secure access control, and more.

***Features***
* Accurate Iris Segmentation: Efficiently identifies and isolates the iris region from the eye image.
* Preprocessing Steps: Reduces noise and enhances image quality for better segmentation.
* Normalization: Converts the circular iris into a standardized rectangular format.
* Visualization: Displays intermediate and final results for inspection.

**1. Requirements**:

Hardware:
Multi-core CPU (e.g., Intel Core i5 or higher).
8 GB RAM (minimum).
GPU (optional for advanced image processing).
Software:
Python 3.6 or higher.
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib (optional for visualization).

**2. Installation**:
1. Clone the Repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-segmentation.git
cd iris-segmentation

2. Create a Virtual Environment:
bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3.Install Dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

**3. Dataset Preparation**:
1. Download Dataset:
Use publicly available datasets like CASIA-IrisV4 or IITD Iris Database.
2. Organize Images:
Place eye images in the images/eyes directory.

**4. Execution Steps**:
1. Run the Project Script:
bash
python iris_segmentation.py

2. Process Workflow:
The script loads images from the images/eyes folder.
Preprocessing includes converting images to grayscale and reducing noise.
Pupil detection and iris segmentation are performed using image processing techniques.
The segmented iris is normalized into a rectangular strip.

3. Visualize Outputs:
Intermediate and final results are displayed in separate windows:
* Input Image
* Segmented Iris
* Pupil Detected
* Normalized Image

4. Exit the Program:
Press the ESC key to close all windows.

**5. Results**:
* Accurate iris and pupil detection.
* Visual representation of segmentation and normalization.
* Prepared data for further biometric analysis.

**6. Future Scope**:
* Integration with multi-modal biometric systems.
* Real-time iris segmentation.
* Adaptation for mobile and wearable devices.
